## Project Workflow

**Does not meet expectations**

Good job with making frequent, well-described commits on your repo.

That said, your project is missing some key components of the planning process,
namely: ERDs, wireframes, and a descriptive README. I'd strongly suggest you
go back and add these so that potential employers can quickly understand your
project.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Great job overall. You've got a relatively complex set of models and
relationships for a P2, and you've used them well. I liked how, for the most
part, you only defined routes you used, and the associated controller actions.

My main suggestions to move forward would be to explore additional features or
libraries you could use to practice managing even more complexity.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds expectations**

I think this is really close to being exceeds expectations. I really like how
your CSS is hand-written, and looks really nice!

## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

Your code quality is overall really good! Just a few places where you should
look into cleaning up dead code (or commented code that's not being used), and
where you can DRY up duplication using partials.

See my inline comments for more.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets expectations**

Overall, you've come really close to building an really great blogging app with
social features! The only reason I'm not marking this as exceeds expectations is
because there are a few features (such as following users) that aren't exposed /
usable yet.

Otherwise, I don't have a lot else to add.
